# SCANED

This study considers a Siamese network built with 3D ResNet to classify collaterals as good/intermediate or poor. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is used to automatically identify ischemic damage and score collaterals from the ischemic site's tissue degeneration. The proposed Siamese collateral assessment network for evaluating collaterals from ischemic damage (SCANED) helped identify significant features from the left/right hemispheres. Considering the Euclidean Distance (ED) as the similarity metric, a dichotomized classification of collaterals into good/intermediate or poor categories was performed based on the optimal threshold from ROC analysis. SCANED provides a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.63 in the dichotomized classification.
